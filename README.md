# 🏋 GymFit Pro - Gym Membership & Workout Tracking System
Problem Statement-3-->Gym Membership & Workout Tracking  System
1. Background 
Gym owners often struggle with managing memberships, tracking attendance, and retaining 
members, while gym-goers find it difficult to track their physical progress, workout routines, 
and diet plans consistently. A disconnected experience leads to low motivation for members 
and operational inefficiencies for owners. 
2. Challenge 
Develop a unified platform that serves both Gym Management (Business) and Members 
(Fitness). The system must streamline administrative tasks like billing and attendance while 
providing members with digital tools to log workouts, track body metrics, and book sessions 
with trainers.
A complete MERN stack application for gym management and member fitness tracking.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MongoDB (running locally on port 27017)
- npm or yarn

### Step 1: Install MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is installed and running:
bash
# Start MongoDB service
mongod


### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

*Backend (.env):*
bash
cd server
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and update values if needed


The server .env file contains:
env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gymapp
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production_12345
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000


*Frontend (.env):*
bash
cd ../client
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env


The client .env file contains:
env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_NAME=GymFit Pro


⚠ *Important:* Never commit .env files to version control! They're already in .gitignore.

### Step 3: Install Server Dependencies
bash
cd server
npm install


### Step 4: Install Client Dependencies
bash
cd ../client
npm install


### Step 5: Start the Backend Server
bash
cd ../server
npm start
